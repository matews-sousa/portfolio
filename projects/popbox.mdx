## Features

- Browse through movies
- View specific movie informations
- View most popular, upcoming and top rated movies
- Filter movies by category
- Search movie

## Approach I Used

I used Next.js to fetch The Movie DB API in the server side, this turns the rendering faster for the user. The TailwindCSS was used to maintain a pattern in the colors, spacing and responsiveness of the website.

## Challenges

The main challenge was to fetch the data properlly and in a organized manner, addapting to the Typescript requirements.

## What I've learned

- Server Side Rendering with Next.js, using to fetch the data faster
- Styling with TailwindCSS
- Typescript
