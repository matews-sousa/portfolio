## Features

- Browse through Movies and TV Series
- View specific Movie or Serie informations
- Filter movies or series by category
- Search movies or series
- Download media covers and posters

## Stack

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) as programming language
- [React](https://reactjs.org) as frontend library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) as state management library

## Approach I Used

I used React with Typescript and Tailwind CSS for styling.

The media data is being fetched from [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) and
the state is being managed by [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest), using advanced features like pagination.

## Challenges

The main challenge was to use React Query the proper way, using the features with the best practices.

## What I've learned

I learned how to use React Query to manage state and how to use search params to keep track of filters and queries.
