## Features

- Authenticate with email and password
- Register incomes and expenses categories
- Register transactions made
- View charts about all transactions

## Approach I Used

I used PHP with Laravel as backend framework and React with TailwindCSS as the frontend stack.

The Laravel API is hosted at [Expense Tracker API](https://expense-tracker-server-production-bfda.up.railway.app).

You can check the [API Repository at GitHub](https://github.com/matews-sousa/expense-tracker-server).

## Challenges

The main challenge was to handle the data that was being inserted into the database, to facilitate the showing the statistics in the user dashboard.

## What I've learned

- PHP
- Laravel
- Authentication with Sanctum
- TailwindCSS for styling
