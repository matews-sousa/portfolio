## Features

- Authenticate with email and password
- Register incomes and expenses categories
- Register transactions made
- View charts about all transactions

## Approach I Used

I used Django REST Framework as backend technology and React.js with TailwindCSS as the frontend stack.

The Django API is hosted at [Expense Tracker API](https://expense-tracker-api-production-8f04.up.railway.app).

You can check the [API Repository at GitHub](https://github.com/matews-sousa/expense-tracker-api).

## Challenges

The main challenge was to handle the data that was being inserted into the database, to facilitate the showing the statistics in the user dashboard.

## What I've learned

- Django REST Framework
- JWT authentication with Django
- TailwindCSS for styling
