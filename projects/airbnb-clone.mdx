## Features

An Airbnb clone would require a set of features that are commonly found in the original application, including:

- User authentication and authorization
- Property listings with photos, descriptions, and pricing
- A booking system that allows users to request reservations and communicate with the property owner
- A payment system that handles transactions and fees
- And others functionalities like: reviews, favorites and canceling reservation

## Stack

- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org): a web application framework built on top of Ruby that provides a structure for building web applications;
- [RSpec](https://rspec.info): a testing library for Ruby;
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): a utility-first CSS framework;
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com): a infrastrucute for secure payments and transactions;
- [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev): a simple JavaScript framework

## Approach

I started seting up the Rails project structure, with RSpec tests, Tailwind and Stimulus. Building a secure user authentication with
the Devise gem.

After this, I implemented the Google Places API in the creation of a Property to help users search a address and populate the data
automatically. Along with this, I added the possibility of uploading multiple images using Active Storage.

And the main feature of payments and reservations was implemented using Stripe, where all the users are a Stripe Customer and a regular
user can become a host by creating a Stripe account. The flow of payment and becoming a host are handled by Stripe and when the users
finishes the process, the application receives a Webhook call and update the user and reservation information with status like "pending",
"paid" or "canceled".

## Challenges

The biggest challenge I faced was to integrate Stripe with my application in a satisfactory way, and figure out how to use webhooks for a
better user experience.

## What I've Learned

Building an Airbnb clone with Ruby on Rails was a great learning experience. I learned a lot about working with Stripe and Webhooks,
they are great tools for implementing a good and secure user experience.

I learned a lot about TDD (Test Driven Development), throught the development I built many tests with with RSpec and saw the necessity
of writing good tests cases along with testing every time to ensure that the application still working.

I also gained a better understanding of how to structure and organize a Rails application for scalability and maintainability, as well as how to handle common challenges that arise when building web applications. Overall, building an Airbnb clone with Ruby on Rails was a challenging but rewarding project that helped me to grow as a developer.
