## Tech Stack

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) as programming language
- [React](https://reactjs.org) as frontend library
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) as BaaS (Backend as a Service)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling
- [Chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) for validating piece movement and a game state
- [Chessboard.jsx](https://chessboardjsx.com) for displaying a Chessboard with pieces

## Approach I Used

I used Supabase's realtime channels to make moves and send messages between games rooms. A user can create a game by picking the piece
color or get a random color and share the game id with a friend to join. As soon as the other player joins, the game starts and Chess.js
makes the moves validations, as well with Chessboard.jsx that displays a beautiful chessboard, handling drag and drop pieces.

## Challenges

The main challenge was to make the realtime work properlly and structuring the data of the game in the database, also making the game state
update the right way in the client side.

## What I've learned

How to use Supabase's realtime channels, making a functional multiplayer game with imediat response and managing a complex game state.

Also I've learned how to use the library [Chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) together with [Chessboard.jsx](https://chessboardjsx.com) to validate, make moves and display them in the screen.
