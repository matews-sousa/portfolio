## Features

- Search songs
- Get suggestion of songs
- Populate a playlist with suggested songs
- Edit playlist info (name, description)
- Create playlist in Spotify Account

## Approach I Used

The user authenticate yourself with NextAuth in their Spotify Account, when they are authenticated, they are able to search songs and get suggestions for a playlist, append songs to the playlist and create in Spotify.

## Challenges

The main challenge was to authenticate the user with Spotify, because the token provided has a complex expiration time, and do not provide a refresh access token to maintain the user connected.

## What I've learned

- Authenticating users with NextAuth
- Using the Spotify Web API
