Make a eficient data structure to the boards, lists and items, storing in the Firestore database and retrieving to the client in the

## What I've learned

How to implement a cool Drag and Drop feature with [DnD Kit](https://dndkit.com), manipulating complex arrays to move items around lists.

Also, I implemented a beautiful Rich Text Editor for users be able to add a detaild description to a card when opened. I built it
using [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev), a headless editor framework that we are able to implement the RTE in our own way.
