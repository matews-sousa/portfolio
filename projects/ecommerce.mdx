## Features

The Ecommerce project offers a range of features to create a comprehensive online shopping experience, including:

- User-friendly and responsive design.
- Detailed product catalog and product pages.
- Seamless shopping cart and secure checkout powered by Stripe integration.
- Admin dashboard for product, order, and inventory management with Sanity.io.
- Search functionality for products.

## Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org): A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io): A headless CMS for easy content management and data storage.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com): A secure payment gateway for online transactions.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): A typed superset of JavaScript, enhancing code safety.
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com): A UI component library for modern and visually appealing interfaces.

## Approach

The development of the Ecommerce project followed these key steps:

1. Setting up the Next.js application structure and integrating Sanity.io as the headless CMS.
2. Creating a comprehensive product catalog with product pages, leveraging the flexibility of Sanity.io.
3. Implementing a seamless shopping cart with the Context API and secure checkout process using Stripe integration.
4. Provide an admin dashboard for efficient management of products, orders, and inventory through Sanity.io.
5. Incorporating search functionality to enhance the user experience.
6. Ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design using shadcd/ui components.

## Challenges

Throughout the development process, some of the challenges faced included:

- **Implementing a Dynamic Shopping Cart with Context API**: One of the significant challenges was creating a dynamic shopping cart that could efficiently manage user-selected products across various pages. Utilizing the Context API for state management required careful design to ensure consistent cart behavior, accurate item counts, and seamless updates as users interacted with the application. Addressing scenarios such as adding/removing items, updating quantities, and managing cart totals demanded thoughtful consideration to maintain a smooth user experience while preventing state-related issues.

- Integrating Stripe effectively to handle payment processing and order management.
- Building a dynamic and responsive user interface using shadcd/ui components.

## What I've Learned

Developing the Ecommerce project using Next.js, Sanity.io, Stripe, TypeScript, and shadcd/ui was an enriching experience. I gained insights into various technologies and best practices:

- Implementing and customizing e-commerce functionalities, including shopping carts and checkouts.
- Working with headless CMS systems like Sanity.io for content management and retrieval.
- Integrating payment gateways like Stripe for secure and seamless transactions.
- Leveraging TypeScript's type system to enhance code quality and maintainability.
- Designing modern user interfaces using the shadcd/ui component library.

This project enhanced my skills in full-stack development, UI/UX design, and project architecture, allowing me to create a feature-rich and user-friendly Ecommerce platform.
